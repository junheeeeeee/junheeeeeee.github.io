I am an Integrated M.S.–Ph.D. student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Korea University, South Korea, and a member of the [Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning Lab](http://pr.korea.ac.kr/), advised by Prof. Seong-Whan Lee.  
For more details, please see my [CV](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My research aims to make **3D human pose estimation** reliable under real-world conditions—robust to occlusion, rare poses, and domain shifts—by developing **scalable** and **uncertainty-aware** models.  
I am also interested in extending 3D understanding to **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** systems for **physics-based animation** and controllable human motion generation.

### Research Interests
- 3D Human Pose Estimation  
- Robust & Scalable Learning (Generalization, Uncertainty)  
- Vision-Language Models & Generative Modeling (Text-to-Image / Text-to-Motion)  
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Physics-Based Animation  

### Education
**Korea University**, Seoul, South Korea  
*Integrated M.S.–Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence* (Mar. 2021 – Present)  
Advisor: Prof. Seong-Whan Lee  

**Soongsil University**, Seoul, South Korea  
*B.S. in Mathematics and Physics (Double Major)* (Mar. 2015 – Aug. 2020)
